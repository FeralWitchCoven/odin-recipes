            <h2>Basic Hamburger Recipe</h2>
            <p>I love burgers. They are a food I'll never turn down. This
                recipe was provided by an anonymous user on Allrecipes.com
                and it is <strong>GOOD!</strong> Try it for yourself!</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Large Egg</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon of Salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon of Ground Black Pepper</li>
                <li>1 lbs. Ground Beef</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of Fine Dry Bread Crumbs</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat
                     and lightly oil grate.</li>
                <li>Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in
                     a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs; mix
                     with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
                <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
                <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and
                     cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired
                     doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted
                     into the center should read at least 160 degrees F
                     (70 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
